# Operating Requirements

This document explains the basic standards used to check systems in this repository.

The rules describe real-world expectations for security, reliability, cost, and consistency. Some systems may only follow part of these rules depending on their size, stage, or purpose. Any differences must be clearly written down.

Operating Requirements show what “good” means. The way we check if systems meet these rules is explained in Quality_Standards.md.

## Security Expectations

Security expectations describe the intended operating posture for systems.

### Identity and Access
- IAM policies are expected to grant only the permissions required for intended functionality.
- Service-to-service access is expected to follow least-privilege principles.
- Privileged access paths are expected to be visible and intentional.

### Network Boundaries
- Network boundaries are expected to isolate workloads by trust zone.
- Security groups are expected to enforce instance-level access controls.
- Network ACLs may be used for additional subnet-level controls where appropriate to scope.

### Encryption and Key Management
- Data at rest is expected to be encrypted using KMS or service-managed mechanisms.
- Data in transit is expected to use TLS or equivalent protections.
- Key usage and rotation expectations are expected to be documented where applicable.

### Auditability and Visibility
- Security-relevant actions are expected to be observable.
- API activity is expected to be traceable where cloud services are used.
- Access logging and retention expectations are expected to be documented.

### Secure Defaults
- Default configurations are expected to favor secure behavior
- Public exposure is expected to be explicit rather than implicit
- Unused ports, protocols, and permissions are expected to be closed or removed

## Reliability Expectations

Reliability expectations describe how systems are intended to behave under normal and failure conditions.

### Failure Awareness
- Likely failure scenarios are expected to be identified
- Critical execution paths are expected to account for failure behavior
- Degraded operation modes may be defined where appropriate

### Retries and Timeouts
- Retry behavior is expected to use backoff strategies where retries apply.
- Timeouts are expected to be explicitly configured.
- Circuit-breaking mechanisms may be appropriate for complex or stateful systems.

### Idempotency and Determinism
- Operations are expected to tolerate safe retries
- Infrastructure provisioning is expected to be repeatable
- State transitions are expected to be predictable

### Rollback and Recovery
- Rollback procedures are expected to be documented
- Rollback behavior is expected to be considered for critical changes
- Automated rollback may be appropriate where deployment automation exists

## Cost Expectations

Cost expectations describe how financial impact is considered during system design.

### Resource Sizing
- Resources are expected to be sized according to intended workload behavior
- Auto-scaling may be appropriate where demand varies
- Utilization is expected to be observable

### Spend Awareness
- Primary cost drivers are expected to be identified
- Guardrails or alerts may be appropriate for systems with ongoing cost profiles
- Spending limits are evaluated relative to system purpose

### Cost Transparency
- Cost implications of design decisions are expected to be explained
- Optimization opportunities may be noted where relevant
- Tradeoffs between cost, reliability, and complexity are expected to be acknowledged

---

## Repeatability Expectations

Repeatability expectations describe how systems can be understood, reviewed, and re-executed.

### Documentation
- Business context and system intent are expected to be documented
- Architecture is expected to be described with sufficient clarity
- Implementation steps are expected to be reproducible

### Validation
- Systems are expected to define how behavior is verified
- Expected and observed results are expected to be recorded
- Supporting evidence is expected where verification is performed

### Version Control
- Code and infrastructure are expected to be version controlled
- Changes are expected to be reviewable
- Rollback through version control is expected where applicable

## Structural Baseline

Engineering Systems are evaluated against the following structural baseline:

- **Business Context** – Problem statement, requirements, constraints, and scope
- **Architecture** – System design, boundaries, and tradeoffs
- **Implementation** – Step-by-step implementation approach
- **Validation** – Verification procedures, observed results, and notes
- **Executions** – Pattern-specific or procedural walkthroughs

This structure supports consistency, traceability, and independent review.
