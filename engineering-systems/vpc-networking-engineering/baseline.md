# Secure VPC Networking Baseline

Secure, isolated network infrastructure implementing a production-oriented VPC baseline.  
This system enforces network isolation through VPC boundaries, restricts access via Security Groups and Network ACLs, and validates network behavior using Flow Logs and controlled connectivity testing.

## Engineering Judgment Highlights

Key architectural decisions and tradeoffs made during system design:

- **/16 CIDR block over smaller address ranges**  
  Selected to provide sufficient address space for subnet growth and future expansion, accepting higher IP consumption to avoid re-addressing and disruptive refactors.

- **NAT Gateway over NAT Instance**  
  Chosen for managed high availability and reduced operational burden, trading higher hourly cost for automatic failover and simplified maintenance.

- **Security Groups as primary enforcement over Network ACLs**  
  Prioritized for stateful behavior and simplified rule management, using NACLs only for coarse-grained defense-in-depth.

- **VPC Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB) over Interface Endpoints**  
  Selected to enable free private connectivity for high-volume services, trading limited service coverage for significant cost savings.

- **VPC Peering over Transit Gateway**  
  Chosen to support a limited VPC count with lower cost and complexity, accepting non-transitive routing and manual route management.

- **Flow Logs to CloudWatch Logs over S3**  
  Enabled real-time visibility and alert integration, trading higher log storage cost for faster analysis and incident response.

- **Public and private subnet segmentation**  
  Implemented to enforce defense-in-depth and controlled internet exposure, accepting additional routing complexity for improved security posture.

## Capabilities Demonstrated

This system implements and validates the following capabilities:

- VPC design with /16 CIDR planning and multi-AZ subnet segmentation
- Public and private subnet routing using Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
- Least-privilege traffic enforcement via Security Groups and Network ACLs
- Private AWS service access through VPC Gateway Endpoints
- Network observability using VPC Flow Logs
- Verified isolation between public and private network tiers

## Scope and Constraints

### In Scope
- Single-region VPC deployment
- CIDR planning and subnet segmentation
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway routing
- Security Groups and Network ACLs
- VPC Gateway Endpoints (S3, DynamoDB)
- Flow Logs for monitoring and validation

### Constraints and Non-Goals
- No multi-region networking
- No Direct Connect or VPN integration
- No advanced routing protocols (BGP, OSPF)
- No custom DNS beyond VPC-provided DNS
- No performance optimization beyond baseline requirements
- No network automation beyond infrastructure-as-code

## What Was Validated

The following behaviors were explicitly verified:

1. VPC created with a /16 CIDR block  
2. Subnets segmented across multiple Availability Zones  
3. Public subnets route through an Internet Gateway  
4. Private subnets route outbound traffic through a NAT Gateway  
5. Security Group rules enforce least-privilege access  
6. VPC Gateway Endpoints keep service traffic within the AWS network  
7. Flow Logs capture network traffic in CloudWatch Logs  
8. Public subnets allow controlled inbound and outbound access  
9. Private subnets allow outbound access only  
10. Unauthorized access attempts are blocked at security boundaries
