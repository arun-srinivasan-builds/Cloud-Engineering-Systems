# Business Context: VPC Networking Engineering

## Executive Summary

This project establishes a **secure, scalable AWS VPC networking baseline** that enables application teams to deploy workloads quickly while maintaining strict security boundaries, predictable costs, and operational transparency.

The business objective is not to “build a VPC,” but to **remove networking as a delivery bottleneck** while reducing security risk and cost volatility as environments scale.

This document defines the problem, requirements, constraints, and success criteria that drive all architectural and implementation decisions in this system.

## Business Problem

Legacy and poorly designed network infrastructure introduces the following recurring business risks:

- Long provisioning cycles due to manual network changes
- Overly permissive network rules that expand security blast radius
- Inconsistent network patterns across environments
- Unpredictable data transfer and NAT-related costs
- Limited visibility into network behavior during incidents

These issues slow delivery, increase operational cost, and raise security exposure as systems grow.

The business requires a network foundation that is **secure by default**, fast to provision, and easy to reason about under operational pressure.

## Business Objectives

The system is designed to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Reduce Time to Provision**  
   Enable complete, production-ready network environments to be deployed in minutes instead of days.

2. **Minimize Security Risk**  
   Enforce deterministic network isolation to prevent unintended lateral movement.

3. **Enable Safe Scalability**  
   Support growth in workloads and environments without re-architecting the network.

4. **Control and Predict Costs**  
   Prevent uncontrolled data transfer and NAT usage that leads to budget overruns.

5. **Improve Operational Confidence**  
   Provide clear network boundaries and observability to support fast troubleshooting and audits.

## Success Criteria (Measurable)

The system is considered successful when the following conditions are met:

- **Network Isolation**
  - Zero unauthorized cross-subnet access
  - All ingress and egress paths explicitly defined and testable

- **Provisioning Speed**
  - Full VPC with subnets, routing, and security controls deployed in under 15 minutes

- **Security Enforcement**
  - Least-privilege security group rules applied to all resources
  - Defense-in-depth implemented via subnet-level controls

- **Private Service Access**
  - AWS service access from private subnets without public internet exposure

- **Observability**
  - 100 percent of network traffic captured via Flow Logs
  - Network behavior auditable during incident review

- **Cost Control**
  - Monthly network infrastructure costs constrained to a defined budget ceiling
  - NAT and data transfer usage measurable and reviewable

Validation against these criteria is documented in `validation.md`.

## Functional Requirements

The system must support:

- Custom CIDR allocation and address planning
- Public, private, and isolated subnet tiers
- Controlled internet ingress and egress
- Private connectivity to AWS services
- Multi-AZ high availability
- Optional multi-VPC connectivity patterns
- Network traffic logging and analysis

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** Defense-in-depth with explicit trust boundaries
- **Reliability:** No single points of failure for critical paths
- **Performance:** Low-latency intra-VPC communication
- **Maintainability:** Clear, documented topology
- **Cost Discipline:** Design decisions evaluated against budget impact

---

## Constraints

The system operates under the following constraints:

**Policy Constraints**
- Single cloud provider (AWS only)
- No multi-cloud networking
- Basic networking patterns only

**Organizational Constraints**
- Team skill sets limited to managed services
- No custom networking tooling development
- Budget constraints for network infrastructure (<$60/month for lab)

**Technical Constraints**
- Network provisioning must complete in <15 minutes
- Single region deployment (ap-south-2 for service availability)
- CIDR allocation must support 10x growth

**Data Classification**
- Network handles standard application traffic
- Requires encryption in transit
- No special compliance requirements beyond standard encryption
