# Implementation: VPC Networking Engineering

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes **how the VPC networking architecture was executed** in a controlled, repeatable manner.

Its role is to:
- Show that architectural intent was translated into concrete actions
- Document execution order and dependencies
- Capture implementation-level decisions and guardrails
- Provide traceability between design, build, and validation

This is not a step-by-step tutorial. It is an execution record.

## Implementation Scope

### In Scope
- Single-region VPC creation
- Subnet segmentation and routing
- Network security controls
- Private AWS service connectivity
- Multi-AZ availability
- Network observability

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Multi-region deployment
- Hybrid connectivity (VPN or Direct Connect)
- Advanced routing protocols
- Application configuration
- Large-scale automation frameworks

Scope boundaries are enforced to prevent execution drift.

---

## Execution Strategy

The system is implemented incrementally to reduce risk and ensure correctness at each stage.

Each phase:
- Introduces a bounded set of changes
- Has clear completion criteria
- Is validated before proceeding to the next phase

This sequencing is deliberate and designed to surface errors early.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Network Foundation

**Objective:** Establish the primary trust boundary and address space.

**Actions**
- Create a custom VPC with a predefined CIDR block
- Enable DNS resolution and hostnames
- Tag all resources consistently for ownership and cost tracking

**Guardrails**
- CIDR sizing validated against future growth requirements
- No routing to the internet at this stage

**Completion Criteria**
- VPC exists with correct CIDR
- No external connectivity paths enabled

---

### Phase 2: Subnet Segmentation and Routing

**Objective:** Enforce network tiering and traffic intent.

**Actions**
- Create public, private, and isolated subnets across multiple AZs
- Associate dedicated route tables to each subnet tier
- Attach Internet Gateway to public route tables only

**Guardrails**
- No shared route tables across tiers
- No default routes in private or isolated subnets

**Completion Criteria**
- Subnets exist in at least two AZs
- Routing reflects intended exposure per tier

---

### Phase 3: Controlled Internet Egress

**Objective:** Allow outbound internet access without exposing internal workloads.

**Actions**
- Deploy NAT Gateways per AZ
- Update private subnet route tables to use NAT
- Restrict NAT usage to private subnets only

**Guardrails**
- NAT Gateway treated as a cost-sensitive resource
- No inbound routes to private subnets

**Completion Criteria**
- Private subnets have outbound access only
- Isolated subnets remain disconnected from the internet

---

### Phase 4: Network Security Enforcement

**Objective:** Apply defense-in-depth security controls.

**Actions**
- Define Security Groups with least-privilege rules
- Apply Security Groups to workloads explicitly
- Configure Network ACLs for coarse-grained subnet controls

**Guardrails**
- Security Groups are the primary enforcement mechanism
- NACLs are not used for application-level logic

**Completion Criteria**
- Unauthorized traffic is blocked by default
- Explicit allow rules are minimal and justified

---

### Phase 5: Private AWS Service Connectivity

**Objective:** Eliminate unnecessary internet traversal for AWS services.

**Actions**
- Configure Gateway VPC Endpoints for high-volume services
- Add Interface Endpoints selectively where required
- Update route tables and security groups accordingly

**Guardrails**
- Gateway Endpoints preferred due to zero hourly cost
- Interface Endpoints limited to justified use cases

**Completion Criteria**
- Private subnets access AWS services without internet routes
- Service connectivity verified without public exposure

---

### Phase 6: Observability and Logging

**Objective:** Make network behavior visible and auditable.

**Actions**
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for all subnets
- Configure log delivery to centralized logging destinations
- Validate log completeness and format

**Guardrails**
- Logging enabled before declaring the system complete
- Log retention balanced against cost

**Completion Criteria**
- Network traffic is observable across all tiers
- Logs available for troubleshooting and audits

---

## Implementation-Level Decisions

### CIDR Allocation
- /16 selected for VPC to support growth
- /24 selected for subnets to balance density and clarity

### Managed Services Preference
- NAT Gateway chosen over NAT Instance for reliability
- Cost accepted where it reduces operational risk

### Security Control Hierarchy
- Security Groups as primary enforcement
- NACLs as secondary protection only

### Cost Discipline
- NAT and endpoint usage monitored continuously
- Architectural changes required to justify cost increases

---

## Validation Hooks

Each phase includes explicit validation hooks:

- Connectivity tests for routing correctness
- Security tests for boundary enforcement
- Log verification for observability
- Cost checks for budget adherence

Validation evidence is documented separately in `validation.md`.

---

## Change Management

- Route table and security changes are reviewed prior to application
- Changes are applied incrementally
- Rollback paths are defined for each phase

Unvalidated changes are treated as defects.

---

## Common Failure Scenarios and Responses

| Scenario | Likely Cause | Response |
|-------|------------|---------|
| No internet from private subnet | NAT or routing issue | Verify route table and NAT health |
| Unexpected inbound access | Overly permissive SG | Audit and restrict rules |
| AWS service unreachable | Endpoint misconfiguration | Validate endpoint and routes |
| Rising network costs | NAT or cross-AZ traffic | Review architecture assumptions |

Failures are expected and planned for.

---

## Execution Summary

This implementation translates architectural intent into a working system through controlled sequencing, explicit guardrails, and continuous validation.

The result is a secure, scalable, and observable network foundation that can be extended without rework.
