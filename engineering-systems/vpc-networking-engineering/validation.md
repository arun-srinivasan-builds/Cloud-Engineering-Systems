# Validation: VPC Networking Engineering

## Purpose

This document provides **objective validation evidence** that the VPC networking system behaves exactly as designed.

It records:
- What was tested
- What was expected
- What was observed
- Where the evidence exists

No rationale.  
No architecture explanation.  
No implementation detail.

## Validation Scope

Validation covers:

- Route table–driven connectivity
- Public vs private vs isolated subnet behavior
- Security group allow/deny enforcement
- EC2 placement and reachability
- Private AWS service access via VPC Endpoints
- Cross-VPC routing via peering
- Network isolation guarantees
- Traffic observability via Flow Logs

## Routing and Reachability

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Public subnet outbound reachability | External access succeeds with IGW route | Connectivity restored after routing validation | 03-routing-boundaries.md |
| Route misconfiguration impact | Traffic fails when route is incorrect | Failure observed until route corrected | 03-routing-boundaries.md |
| ICMP reachability | Ping succeeds when routing and SG allow | ICMP responses confirmed | 03-routing-boundaries.md |
| Application-layer egress | curl retrieves external content | HTML content retrieved successfully | 03-routing-boundaries.md |

---

## Security Group Enforcement

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Default inbound deny | Unspecified inbound traffic blocked | Traffic blocked | 04-network-security-groups.md |
| Explicit inbound allow | Allowed traffic succeeds | Connectivity confirmed | 04-network-security-groups.md |
| Outbound rule enforcement | Only permitted egress succeeds | Behavior aligned with rules | 04-network-security-groups.md |
| Lateral movement control | Cross-subnet traffic blocked unless allowed | Unauthorized access blocked | 04-network-security-groups.md |

---

## EC2 Networking Behavior

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Public EC2 placement | Instance reachable when SG allows | Public server reachable | 07-ec2-networking.md |
| Private EC2 placement | No direct inbound internet access | Inbound blocked as expected | 07-ec2-networking.md |
| EC2 outbound connectivity | Egress succeeds per routing design | Outbound connectivity confirmed | 07-ec2-networking.md |

---

## Private AWS Service Connectivity (S3)

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| S3 access via VPC Endpoint | Access without public internet routing | Access confirmed via endpoint | 05-vpc-endpoints.md |
| S3 object upload | Write succeeds with correct permissions | Object upload succeeded | 06-s3-networking.md |
| S3 access control | Access denied when permissions incorrect | Denial observed until corrected | 06-s3-networking.md |

---

## Multi-VPC Connectivity (Peering)

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Peering without routes | No connectivity | Connectivity failed as expected | 08-vpc-peering-advanced.md |
| Peering with routes | Connectivity succeeds | Cross-VPC traffic confirmed | 08-vpc-peering-advanced.md |
| Route table dependency | Routes required on both sides | Behavior validated | 08-vpc-peering-advanced.md |

---

## Isolated Subnet Controls

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Internet egress | No outbound internet access | Connectivity failed as expected | 09-isolated-network-test.md |
| Route isolation | No IGW or NAT routes present | Routes confirmed absent | 09-isolated-network-test.md |
| Network ACL enforcement | Traffic filtered per isolation rules | Behavior matched configuration | 09-isolated-network-test.md |

---

## Observability (VPC Flow Logs)

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|----|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Flow Logs enabled | Logs capture traffic | Logs delivered successfully | 10-flow-logs-validation.md |
| Accepted traffic visibility | ACCEPT records present | Confirmed | 10-flow-logs-validation.md |
| Rejected traffic visibility | REJECT records present | Confirmed | 10-flow-logs-validation.md |
| Troubleshooting support | Logs usable for diagnosis | Used to validate routing | 10-flow-logs-validation.md |

---


## Negative Testing Summary

| Scenario | Expected Result | Observed Result | Evidence |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Incorrect routing | Connectivity failure | Failure observed | 03-routing-boundaries.md |
| Isolated subnet egress | Internet access blocked | Block confirmed | 09-isolated-network-test.md |

## Known Limitations

- Validation performed in a single AWS region
- Non-production environment
- Manual connectivity tests used
- Cost validation limited to functional behavior

---

## Validation Conclusion

All defined validation checks passed.

The system demonstrably enforces:
- Deterministic routing behavior
- Explicit security boundaries
- Correct EC2 networking behavior
- Private AWS service access
- Strong isolation guarantees
- Observable and auditable traffic flow

This confirms alignment between **architecture intent**, **implementation**, and **runtime behavior**.
